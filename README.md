## Introduction
`DreemNav` is an iOS UIKit navigation wrapper designed for SwiftUI.

As the native navigation component provided by SwiftUI lacked legacys animation, this library has been
built to wrap the old good UIKit system and provide it through a SwiftUI interface and a developer friendly
way to implement it.
 
## Public architecture
### NavController
Which is the part of the Navigation that orchestrate how screens are displayed.
It holds public methods that will be useful to perform navigation through the app.

### NavGraphBuilder
Which defines how to build screens of the app.
It is declared once into the NavController parameters.

### NavHost 
This is the View holder where each screen declared into the NavGraphBuilder will be displayed. 


## Initialization
Let admit that you have four different screens :
- Splash
- Home
- FirstName
- LastName

First of all you have to set up a `NavController` that takes as parameters :
1) root: The name of the first screen that you want to be displayed.
2) builder: The way above screens will be built

```swift
@main
struct SampleApp: App {
    @ObservedObject var controller =
        NavController(
            root: "Splash"
        ) { graph in
            graph.screen("Splash") { SplashScreen() }
            graph.screen("Home") { HomeScreen() }
            graph.screen("FirstName") { FirstNameScreen() }
            graph.screen("LastName") { navParams in
                let firstName = navParams["first_name"] as! String
                LastNameScreen(firstName: firstName)
            }
        }
    ...
}
```
As you can see in the above example, we have told to the `NavController` how to initialize **Four named screens**.
"LastName" builder is particular as it takes a **navParam** as entry parameter,
which is a `[String: Any]` that holds data passed through a push method call - see [push](#push) section.     

Now that we have defined how our screens will be built, we must pass the `NavController` to the `NavHost`
in order to display those screens.
```swift
@main
struct SampleApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            NavHost(controller: controller)
        }
    }
}
```

And ... Thats it ! Everything is ready, you can now manage the navigation using 
your newly set navControllers public methods from anywhere in your app !

> **Warning**
> In order to manipulate the navigation properly, you have to use the same instance 
> of the `NavController` that you have passed to `NavHost` as parameter.
>
> Consider using an IOC library such as **[Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject)**
> Or a singleton design pattern.


## NavController methods summary
### push
Use this method display a new screen.
You can pass **arguments** through the screen pushed :
```swift
private class FirstNameViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private var controller: NavController = resolve()
    @Published private(set) var firstName: String = ""

    func setFirstName(value: String) { self.firstName = value }
    
    func goToLastName() {
        controller.push(
            screenName: "LastName",
            arguments: ["first_name": firstName]
        )
    }
}
```

Those arguments are handled into the `NavGraphBuilder` :
```swift
@main
struct SampleApp: App {
    @ObservedObject var controller =
        NavController(
            root: ...
        ) { graph in
            ...
            graph.screen("LastName") { navParams in
            //HERE
                let firstName = navParams["first_name"] as! String
                LastNameScreen(firstName: firstName)
            }
        }
    ...
}
```

### pop
Use this method to remove screens from the stack.
You can pass **arguments** to the screen that will be displayed back
and chose a **specific screen** that you want to be at the top of the stack :
```swift
private class LastNameViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private var controller: NavController = resolve()
    @Published private(set) var lastName: String = ""
    private(set) var firstName: String = ""
    
    func backToFirstName() { controller.pop() } //Simple pop.
    
    func backToHome() {
        controller.pop( //Pop with arguments and specific destination.
            to: "Home",
            arguments: [
                "first_name": firstName,
                "last_name": lastName,
            ]
        )
    }
}
```
Those arguments are handled into the place where you are navigating back (see [setOnNavigateBack](#setOnNavigateBack))

### setOnNavigateBack
Allows you to define how the app should handle arguments on a **pop** navigation :
```swift
private class HomeViewModel: ObservableObject 
    private static var INSTANCE: HomeViewModel? = nil
    private var controller: NavController = resolve()
    @Published private(set) var firstName: String = ""
    @Published private(set) var lastName: String = ""
    
    private init() {
        controller.setOnNavigateBack { args in
            if let firstName = args["first_name"] as? String, !firstName.isEmpty { //HERE
                self.firstName = firstName
            }
            
            if let lastName = args["last_name"] as? String, !lastName.isEmpty { //AND HERE
                self.lastName = lastName
            }
        }
    }
...
}
```

### showModal
Presents a **sheet** from the bottom of the screen
```swift
private class HomeViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private var controller: NavController = resolve()
    @Published private(set) var firstName: String = ""

    func goToFirstName() {
        controller.showModal(
            screenName: Route.FirstName.name,
            arguments: ["first_name": firstName]
        )
    }
}
```
Arguments can be passed and handle just as described in the **[push](#push)** part.

### dismissModal
Dismiss the **sheet** if it is presented.
```swift
private class HomeViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private var controller: NavController = resolve()
    
    func closeModal() {
        controller.dismissModal()
    }
}
```

### clearBackstack
Removes each screen from the backstack excepted the last one.
```swift
private class HomeViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private var controller: NavController = resolve()
    
    func clearBackstack() {
        controller.clearBackstack()
    }
}
```
